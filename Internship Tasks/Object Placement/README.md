# Project Overview

## Problem Statement
At the specified time, the agent is encountering difficulties in accurately calculating coordinates to place objects on a platform.

## Solution Goals
The primary goal is to develop a robust algorithm that allows the robot to accurately place objects on the platform, taking into account their dimensions and the available areas on the platform.

### Development States
1. **Developing a Field of View (FOV) for the Platform**
    - **Status**: Ongoing
    - **Attempt 1**: Experimented with basic thresholding and color segmentation techniques. Results were not accurate enough.
    - **Attempt 2**: Utilized OpenCV's background subtraction and Gaussian mixture algorithms. While better than the previous attempt, it still had issues with environmental effects.
    - **Attempt 3**: Exploring the use of depth data for object detection.
    - **Attempt 4**: Creating a custom lightweight object detection tool.

2. **Algorithm for Optimal Object Arrangement**
    - **Status**: Coming Soon

## Implementation Notes
- All functions in the codebase are documented with comments explaining their tasks and implementation details.
- Documentation Structure:
    - **TAKES**: Inputs required by the function.
    - **DOES**: Description of what the function accomplishes and how it achieves it.
    - **RETURN**: Output returned by the function.
- Each part of the documentation follows the notation: [x-ly_lz], where [x] represents the task number, [y] denotes the beginning line, and [z] denotes the ending line.
